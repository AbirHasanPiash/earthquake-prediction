# Earthquake Prediction Models
## Description
I conducted research on earthquake prediction and developed several machine learning models to forecast earthquake magnitude and significance, aiming to identify the best-performing approach. I used a large dataset from Kaggle containing over 3.4 million earthquake records spanning from 1990 to 2023. The dataset was processed, and the models were trained and evaluated in Google Colab. Due to resource constraints, some large model predictions were saved as CSV files and re-imported to consolidate results. This repository includes the Python code for data loading, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
