# earthquake-prediction
I conducted research on earthquake prediction and developed several machine learning models to forecast earthquake magnitude and significance in order to identify the best-performing approach. I used a large dataset from Kaggle containing over 3.4 million earthquake records spanning from 1990 to 2023.
